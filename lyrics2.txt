2$See it ain't about the Benjamins or Pentiums or Athlons,
2$But you rappin' 50 meters while I'm spittin' in decathlons.
2$Your shit's old and busted, mine's the new hotness;
2$You're like CLR and I'm like CLRS.
2$You're running csh and my shell is bash,
2$You're the tertiary storage; I'm the L1 cache.
2$I'm a web crawling spider; you an Internet mosquito;
2$You thought the 7-layer model referred to a burrito.
2$You're a dialup connection; I'm a gigabit LAN.
2$I last a mythical man-month; you a one-minute man.
2$It's like I'm running Thunderbird and you're still stuck with Pine,
2$Which is why I think it's time for me to KILL DASH NINE.

1$Yeah it's KILL DASH NINE
2$No more CPU time.
1$'Cause it's KILL DASH NINE,
2$And your process is mine.
1$I said KILL DASH NINE
2$'Cause it's my time to shine,
1$So don't step outta line or else it's
2$KILL DASH NINE!

1$My posse throws down like leaky bucket regulators;
1$I was coding shit in MIPS while you were playing Space Invaders.
1$With my finger on the trigger I run ./configure
1$Yo, this package is big, but MY package is bigger.
1$I roll my weed with Zig Zag while I zag-zig splay,
1$And I do a bounds check before I write to an array.
1$I'm a loc'd out baller writing KLOCS a day,
1$'Cause it's publish or perish, fool, what can I say?
1$I'm 26 now, will I live to see 28?
1$Some days I wonder if I'll survive to graduate.
1$But hey, that's just fine, I won't ever resign,
1$And if fools try to step then it's KILL DASH NINE!

1$Yeah it's KILL DASH NINE,
2$From my command line
1$It's KILL DASH NINE
2$Sending chills down your spine,
1$I said KILL DASH NINE,
2$'Cause it's my time to shine,
1$So don't step outta line or else it's
2$KILL DASH NINE!

2$fs sa rlidwka
2$I'll chown your home and take your access away
2$Comin' straight outta Stanford, ain't nobody tougher,
2$Control-X, Control-C, I'll discard your fuckin' buffer.
2$You're outside your scope, son, close them curly brackets,
2$'Cause I drop punk-ass bitches like a modem drops packets.
2$Dump your motherfucking core, and trace your stack
2$'Cause where your ass is going, there won't be no callback.
2$See my style is divine and my code is sublime,
2$My career's in a climb and yours is in a decline.
2$I'll write a pound-define and assign you as mine,
2$So refine those sad rhymes or remove your plus signs,

1$Or it's KILL DASH NINE,
2$No more CPU time,
1$'Cause it's KILL DASH NINE,
2$And your process is mine,
1$I said KILL DASH NINE
2$'Cause it's my time to shine,
1$Bitch you stepped outta line and now it's 
2$KILL DASH NINE!
